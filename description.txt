Thesis description:

1. Research the possibilities of obtaining opendata from Slovak government and Slovak municipalities.
2. Select those with the most accessible opendata and research their APIs and datasets.
3. From the possible datasets, select a subset with logical ties (such as real estate ownership
vs company ownership in a given town, waste management vs waste routes and companies, etc),
interconnect these sets and publish them.
4. Confront your solution with similar existing projects (such as uvostat.sk)
5. Try to push your solution upstream to the original source.
